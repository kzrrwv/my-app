# Calculator

## Description
    This project is a simple calculator implemented in Java. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and calculate the factorial of a number.
    The calculator works through the command line, prompting the user for the necessary data for calculations.

## What does the application do
    Addition (+) - adds two entered numbers.
    Subtraction (-) - subtracts one number from another.
    Multiplication (*) - multiplies two entered numbers.
    Division (/) - divides one number by another. Division by zero is handled.
    Factorial (!) - calculates the factorial of an entered integer.
